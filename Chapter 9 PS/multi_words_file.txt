The ****** was walking slowly across the *****. 
The ****er loved his ****** because it helped 
him carry crops from the **** to the market. 
Every morning, the ****** would leave the **** 
and head toward the ***** to start working. 
The ***** was large, but the loyal ****** 
never complained.
