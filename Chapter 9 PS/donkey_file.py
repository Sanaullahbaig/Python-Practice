There was once a ###### who lived in a small village.
The ###### was very hardworking, but the farmer often 
overloaded the ###### with heavy sacks. One day, the 
###### decided to rest near a river, where another 
###### was drinking water. Both ######s started talking 
about how tired ######s get after working all day. 
Later, the farmer came looking for his ######, and 
when he saw two ######s, he got confused about which 
###### was his!
